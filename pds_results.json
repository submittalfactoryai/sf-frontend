    "pdf_summary": "Pecora 890NST is a non-staining, single-component, neutral cure silicone sealant specifically formulated for sealing joints where staining of adjacent substrates is a concern. It's designed for weatherproofing and offers excellent adhesion and elasticity. The sealant conforms to ASTM C920, Type S, Grade NS, Class 50.",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "justification": "This is the TDS for Pecora 890 (NST) which explicitly mentions 'non-staining' and confirms compliance with ASTM C 920, Type S, Grade NS. While the Class is listed as 50, not 100/50, the other key characteristics and explicit mention of being non-staining makes it a very strong match."
